# Kaggle chanllenge for Kernel methods for machine learning course at ENS Paris saclay (MVA 2023-2024)

## Overview:
The primary goal was to learn how to implement machine learning algorithms and adapt them to the structure of the data. I ended up in second position in Leaderboard

## Key Components:
- **SIFT Feature Extraction**: Utilizing the SIFT algorithm to extract key features from images, enabling robust local feature representation.
- **Chi2 Distance Metric**: Employing the Chi2 distance metric to quantify the dissimilarity between histograms of SIFT features, allowing for effective comparison and classification.
- **One vs One Classification**: Implementing the One vs One classification approach to handle multi-class classification tasks, particularly addressing challenges posed by visually similar classes.
- **Local Test Set Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on a local test set, focusing on classes with high visual similarity, such as dogs, deer, and birds.
- **Visualization and Analysis**: Providing visualizations, including confusion matrices and error rates, to analyze model performance and identify areas for improvement.
