# Kaggle chanllenge for Kernel methods for machine learning course at ENS Paris saclay (MVA 2023-2024)

## Overview:
The primary goal was to learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch using kernel method and adapt them to the structure of the data.

## Key Components:
- **SIFT and HOG Feature Extraction**: Utilizing the SIFT and HOG algorithm to extract key features from images.
- **Chi2 and Gaussian Kernel**: Employing the Gaussian and Chi2 kernel to quantify the dissimilarity between SIFT/HOG features, allowing for effective comparison and classification
- **One vs All and One vs One approaches** for multi-class classification
