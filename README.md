# Kaggle chanllenge for Kernel methods for machine learning course at ENS Paris saclay (MVA 2023-2024)

## Overview:
The primary goal was to learn how to implement machine learning algorithms and adapt them to the structure of the data. I ended up in second position in Leaderboard

## Key Components:
- **SIFT Feature Extraction**: Utilizing the SIFT algorithm to extract key features from images, enabling robust local feature representation.
- **Chi2 Kernel**: Employing the Chi2 distance metric to quantify the dissimilarity between histograms of SIFT features, allowing for effective comparison and classification
